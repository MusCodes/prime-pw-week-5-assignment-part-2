    <!-- I had trouble linking the background image. I didnt use the dot notation
    because Vscode auto filled where the record.png was located soon as I typed / 
  and it even showed me the record.png pic when I followed its path but it didn't showing up 
when I opened  it in the browser and the console was stating that it couldn't find the file.
My question is, If vsCode can follow the path, and show me the image, why didn't it 
display when I open it on chrome?-->
